# Chapter One - Values, Types and Operators

- Every value stored in a computer is stored in long sequences of bits (zeros and ones), as such, they all look alike.
- Remembrance on converting data types from binary to decimal to octal and vice versa.

  ```
  // For instance converting 13 as decimal to binary ()
  // The method is to divide the decimal by 2 until you get an absolute 0

  13 / 2 = 6 r 1
  6  / 2 = 3 r 0
  3  / 2 = 1 r 1
  1  / 2 = 0 r 1

  13 in decimal = 1101 in binary
  
  // TO convert back to binary.
  3           2            1           0
  1           1            0           1
  (2^3 x 1) + (2^2 x 1) + (2^1 x 0) + (2^0 x 1) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

  ```
- Creation of multiple values while using them simultaneously could make the computer run out of memory
